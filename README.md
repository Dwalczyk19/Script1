# Script 1 URP

This python file will take a variety of .txt files all labeling roughly 3-12 responses of specific interview questions (the questions will be labeled below and .txt files will be attached). 

The file itself will output several dictionaries and values looking for uniqueness of word length and average response (sentence) length.

- Q1 ==> Describe a situation in which you were able to positively influence the actions of others.

- Q2 ==> Tell me about the most rewarding customer service experience you've had and what made it so rewarding?

- Q3 ==> Why do you want to work for "Us"? 

- Q4 ==> In your opinion, is there such a thing as an unrealistic demand from a customer?

- Q5 ==> What if you are not based in the state that you currently live? What housing options have you considered?
